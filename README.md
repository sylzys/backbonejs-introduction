Backbone.js introduction
---------------

This project is a codebase for my Caencamp' lecture, on May 30th, 2013.

It introduces Backbone.js architecture and main features, with a simple moderable comment system.

In this application, we use model, collection, view, routes and events.

**TAGS**

- no_templates: messages are rendered by appending html code directly within the view
- templating: messages are rendered bye an underscore.js template (COFFEE version available)
- routers : a router is used to display and edit a single message by its id

**TODO**

- [X] adding the router fonctionnality to manage multiple messages
